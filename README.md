# twitter-bot-tutorial
This tutorial uses Python and the package [tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) in order to create a bot which tweets random bits of laughter.

You can print out the handout, [wugbot_twitter.pdf](https://github.com/wugology/twitter-bot-tutorial/blob/master/wugbot_twitter.pdf?raw=true), and follow along with the [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hcezyxtb58). By the end of the YouTube video, you'll have created a file similar to [laughbot.py](https://github.com/wugology/twitter-bot-tutorial/blob/master/laughbot.py).
